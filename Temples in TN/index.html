            <p>Mamallapuram, also known as Mahabalipuram, is a town in Chengalpattu district in the southeastern Indian
                state of Tamil Nadu, best known for the UNESCO World Heritage Site of 7th- and 8th-century Hindu Group
                of Monuments at Mahabalipuram. It is one of the famous tourist sites in India.[1] The ancient name of
                the place is Thirukadalmallai.The earliest mention of the city is found in the 1st century work called
                Periplus of the Erythraean Sea by an unknown Greek navigator. Ptolemy, the Greek geographer refers this
                place as Malange. Mahabalipuram is also known by other names such as Mamallapattana and Mamallapuram.
                The term Mamallapuram means the city of Mamalla, the other name of the famous Pallava Emperor
                Narasimhavarman I (630-670 CE) who built the famous temples in the city. Thirumangai Alvar, the famous
                Vaishnavite saint mentions this place as Thirukadalmallai, referring to the Sthalasayana Perumal
                Temple.[5] Another name by which Mahabalipuram has been known to mariners, at least since Marco Polo's
                time is "Seven Pagodas" alluding to the Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram that stood on the shore, of which
                one, the Shore Temple, survives.</p>

            <p>Arulmigu Meenakshi Sundaraswarar Temple is a historic Hindu temple located on the southern bank of the
                Vaigai River[3] in the temple city[4] of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. It is dedicated to the goddess
                Meenakshi, a form of Parvati, and her consort, Sundareshwarar, a form of Shiva.[5] The temple is at the
                center of the ancient temple city of Madurai mentioned in the Tamil Sangam literature, with the goddess
                temple mentioned in 6th-century-CE texts.[6] This temple is one of the Paadal Petra Sthalams. The Paadal
                Petra sthalams are 275 temples of lord Shiva that are revered in the verses of Tamil Saiva Nayanars of
                6th-9th century CE.

                The west tower (gopuram) of the temple is the model based on which the Tamil Nadu State Emblem is
                designed

                Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple was built by Pandayan Emperor Sadayavarman Kulasekaran I (1190
                CE–1205 CE). He built the main Portions of the three-storeyed Gopuram at the entrance of Sundareswarar
                Shrine and the central portion of the Goddess Meenakshi Shrine are some of the earliest surviving parts
                of the temple. The traditional texts call him a poet-saint king, additionally credit him with a poem
                called Ambikai Malai, as well as shrines (koil) each for Natarajar and Surya near the main temple,
                Ayyanar in the east, Vinayagar in the south, Kariamalperumal in the west and Kali in the north. He also
                built a Mahamandapam. Kulasekara Pandya was also a poet and he composed a poem on Meenakshi named
                Ambikai Malai.[9] Maravarman Sundara Pandyan I built a gopuram in 1231, then called Avanivendaraman,
                later rebuilt, expanded and named as Sundara Pandya Thirukkopuram.[9] Chitra gopuram (W), also known as
                Muttalakkum Vayil, was built by Maravarman Sundara Pandyan II (1238-1251). This gopuram is named after
                the frescoes and reliefs that depict secular and religious themes of Hindu culture. Maravarman Sundara
                Pandyan II also added a pillared corridor to the Sundareswara shrine and the Sundara Pandyan
                Mandapam.[9] It was rebuilt after the 14th-century damage, its granite structure was renovated by Kumara
                Krishnappar after 1595.[10]

                Though the temple has historic roots, most of the present campus structure was rebuilt after the 14th
                century AC, further repaired, renovated and expanded in the 17th century by Tirumala Nayaka.[11][12] In
                the early 14th century, the armies of Delhi Sultanate led by Muslim Commander Malik Kafur plundered the
                temple, looted it of its valuables and destroyed the Madurai temple town along with many other temple
                towns of South India.[13][14][15] The contemporary temple is the result of rebuilding efforts started by
                the Vijayanagara Empire rulers who rebuilt the core and reopened the temple.[13][16] In the 16th
                century, the temple complex was further expanded and fortified by the Nayak ruler Vishwanatha Nayakar
                and later others. The restored complex now houses 14 gopurams (gateway towers), ranging from 45–50 m in
                height, with the southern gopura tallest at 51.9 metres (170 ft). The complex has numerous sculpted
                pillared halls such as Aayirankaal (1000-pillared hall), Kilikoondu-mandapam, Golu-mandapam and
                Pudu-mandapam. Its shrines are dedicated to Hindu deities and Shaivism scholars, with the vimanas above
                the garbhagrihas (sanctums) of Meenakshi and Sundaresvara gilded with gold.[16][17][18]

                The temple is a major pilgrimage destination within the Shaivism tradition, dedicated to Meenakshi Devi
                and Shiva. However, the temple includes Vishnu in many narratives, sculptures and rituals as he is
                considered to be Meenakshi's brother.[19] This has made this temple and Madurai as the "southern
                Mathura", one included in Vaishnava texts.[20][21] The Meenakshi temple also includes Lakshmi, flute
                playing Krishna, Rukmini, Brahma, Saraswati, other Vedic and Puranic deities, as well as artwork showing
                narratives from major Hindu texts. The large temple complex is the most prominent landmark in Madurai
                and attracts tens of thousands visitors a day.[22] The temple attracts over a million pilgrims and
                visitors during the annual 10-day Meenakshi Tirukalyanam festival, celebrated with much festivities and
                a ratha (chariot) procession during the Tamil month of Chittirai (overlaps with April–May in Georgian
                calendar, Chaitra in North India).[23] The Temple has been adjudged best 'Swachh Iconic Place' in India
                as on 1 October 2017 under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
